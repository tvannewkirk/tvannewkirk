<h1>Hi, I'm Tanner! <br/></h1>

<h2>About:</h2>
I am someone who is excited by the opportunity to help users with technology and to expand my understanding of computer systems through solving problems and learning. I am pursuing a role where I will be able to combine my customer service experience with my technical skills to solve user issues quickly and efficiently. My goal is to provide empathy to customers and to ensure the problem solving process is as smooth as possible. I have two years of customer service experience and approximately one year of IT experience.
<br /><br/>
I recently completed the CompTIA A+ certification and I appreciated the opportunity to learn the material as it gave me a basic understanding of some of the disciplines within Information Technology. While studying for the certification, I learned that I was particularly interested in hardware and software troubleshooting, networking, operating systems and security. My goal is to continue applying the concepts I learned from the certification and to continue the process of learning.
<br /><br />
I also completed the Cisco Certified Network Associate Certification which validated my skills in IP routing and IP connectivity, network security fundamentals and access control, VLANs and trunking and many more topics. I enjoyed the opportunity to work directly with Cisco equipment such as a 2960 switch and to learn the technologies through hands-on projects and labs. This certification provides a strong foundation for those who want to expand their knowledge and experience into the field of networking. I look forward to the challenge of completing the Cisco Certified Network Professional Enterprise Core Exam following my previous exam. I expect to complete this portion of the Cisco Certified Network Professional certification by April 2026.
